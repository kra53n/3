The default recursive directory scanning is pretty simple and it is
just a dfs (Depth First Search).

But it make sense to use multiple cores to speedup the directory
traversal.

And at this point we have a difficulty to manage several threads. To
do this we need to choose some strategy. Below will be produced some
of this stratetegy that may be already exists or not (who knows).


The strategy.

<<<<<<< HEAD
---
=======
>>>>>>> 970a199 (add algo)
Like in the simple dfs algo we are met the leaf of the branch.
If branch has more the maxLeafs (max leafs at the branch) it means
that we can run algo in a new thread at the prev level.

<<<<<<< HEAD
What we solve? We solve the problem that in one level we can not to
easily say how much files we have and properly divide it. Thats why we
use a trick with levels.


The question: how will we concatenate properly the result from a
different threads?
